# Mine sweeper like game for phyton course
I'm currently going through a Python course and developing a basic understanding of how to write code. This is my "long-term" projec, that test all what i learned.

# My gols:    
Build a fundamental understanding of code structure
Get familiar with programming logic
Use classes, functions, exceptions, and various data types
Write a meaningful program
# How to run
set your line to emulate terminal and run code
# What should be in project:  
Core logic
At least two classes
Exceptions
Tests for functions
Communicate with an API 
Save data to a .txt file    

# Road map
build base line of code     
user interface  
setting for difficulty  
logging functions   
API function --> like global leader board   
generating save file    
add timer   
create stand alone .exe 
# current plan of architecture 
...
