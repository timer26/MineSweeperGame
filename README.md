# Mine sweeper like game for phyton course
I'm currently going through a Python course and developing a basic understanding of how to write code. This is my "long-term" projec, that test all what i learned.<br>

# My gols:    
Build a fundamental understanding of code structure <br>
Get familiar with programming logic <br>
Use classes, functions, exceptions, and various data types <br>
Write a meaningful program<br>
# How to run
set your line to emulate terminal and run code<br>
# What should be in project:  
Core logic<br>
At least two classes<br>
Exceptions<br>
Tests for functions<br>
Communicate with an API <br>
Save data to a .txt file <br>   

# Road map
build baseline of code <br>    
user interface  <br>
<s> settings for difficulty <br>
settings for log <br>
logging functions   </s>     <br>
API function --> like global leader board  <br>
generating save file<br>
add timer<br>
create stand alone .exe <br>
# current plan of architecture 
...
